# Trilateration

<p>
<em>
"In geometry, trilateration is the process of determining absolute
or relative locations of points by measurement of distances, using
the geometry of circles, spheres or triangles.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to its interest as a geometric problem, trilateration
does have practical applications in surveying and navigation,
including global positioning systems (GPS). In contrast to
triangulation, it does not involve the measurement of angles."</em>

## How to use

1. Go to : <https://syook.github.io/Trilateration/index.html><br>
2. Provide cordinates likes x, y and radius for all three circles and click draw.<br> 
3. Enter cordinates such that circle's arc intersect each other to form Trilateration.<br> 
4. Finally click Trilaterate to form the Trilateration<br>

### Here is sample data: 

    Circle1
    x1 = 0;
    y1 = 0;
    rad = 10;

    Circle2
    x1 = 11;
    y1 = 0;
    rad = 10;

    Circle3
    x1 = 6.3;
    y1 = 7.1;
    rad = 10;

    Trilateration: 
    
    x= "05.5"
    y:"01.464788732394366"
    z:1
